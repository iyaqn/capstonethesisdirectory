              <p>
                The University of Santo Tomas (UST), founded on April 28, 1611,
                is the oldest university in Asia and the largest Catholic
                university in the world located on a single campus. Established
                by Bishop Miguel de Benavides, O.P., UST began as a
                seminary-college to prepare men for the priesthood, funded by a
                donation of 1,500 pesos and Benavides' personal library.
                Originally named Colegio de Nuestra Se√±ora del Santisimo
                Rosario, it was later renamed in honor of St. Thomas Aquinas.
                UST was authorized to grant degrees in theology and philosophy
                in 1619 and was elevated to university status by Pope Innocent X
                in 1645.
